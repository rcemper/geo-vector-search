# Geographic use of vector search
The example loads a list of worldwide capitals with their coordinates   
The coordinates are interpreted as vectors from geographic point 0Â°N/0 W  
(some very wet spot in the Gulf of Guinea, >400 km from the African Coast)   
Finding common directions from that spot is a quite theoretical case.   
So adjustment to your preferred starting point is implemented.   
Now finding **similar** directions for some target city makes sense.   
It's a methematical use of VECTOR_COSINE() function other than text search.   
Because test Vectora ar just 2-dimensional it's easy to follow the reults.
Though, you have to be aware that the calculation checks directions, not lenght.    
So a vector from Paris to Bejing is SIMILAR by direction to Budapest or Tashkent.  
    
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
### Installation
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rcemper/geo-vector-search.git
```
To build and start the container run:
```
$ docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```
To open IRIS Terminal do:
```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris
