# Geographic use of vector search
The example loads a list of worldwide capitals with their coordinates   
The coordinates are interpreted as vectors from geographic point 0Â°N/0 W  
(some very wet spot in the Gulf of Guinea, >400 km from the African Coast)   
Finding common directions from that spot is a quite theoretical case.   
So adjustment to your preferred starting point is implemented.   
Now finding **similar** directions for some target city makes sense.   
It's a methematical use of VECTOR_COSINE() function other than text search.
